  :rocket: Used Technologies
</h2>

- [ReactJS](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) to build the app in general
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) to style all the app(components, views and so on)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to make multiple routes
- [Sweet Alert](https://sweetalert.js.org/) to make some toast messages
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to make the all the requests to the API
- [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/reference/) to get all the data that the app uses

  :dart: Project's goal
</h2>

The aim of this project was practicing React, a great tech that I've started learning recently, with this app, I could practice some concepts like props, conditional rendering, components managment in React, styling with styled components, I enjoyed it really much and I'll keep learning React for sure, I really liked it!

<h2 id="how-to-use" name="how-to-use">
  :information_source: How to Run
</h2>

Follow the steps below to run the project in your machine, before it all, you need to have the Git, Node.js and Yarn installed on your computer, then follow the steps below:

```bash
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/TiagoDiass/book-finder.git

# Enter in the directory
$ cd book-finder

# Install the dependencies
$ yarn

# Start the app
$ yarn start
```

After following these steps, your terminal will show you what port is the app running on(it's usually the 3000), so you'll just need to open your browser
and open `localhost:3000`. To stop the app just go back to the terminal and press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

Hope you enjoyed this project :smiley:<br>
